# objective:

This project aims to develop a conversational language model (LLM) tailored for a business environment. This model should provide general support, manage new account openings, block credit cards, and advise on investments, loans, and insurance. The model should be trained using a static dataset (knowledge-base. md and conversations.json) and be capable of querying a live data source (live-datasource.json) at runtime to provide up-to-date information to users.
